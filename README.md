# WP3_electrofishing
Design an international database of habitat of migratory fish (deliverable D3.1)

Electrofishing data is crucial for monitoring migratory fish populations and are used by countries to carry out regional assessments. Such data are also required to develop Species Distribution Model in continental habitats, one of the key steps of WKFEA. Based on the db of T3.1, this database will be designed to handle such data. It builds on existing databases (e.g. Sudoang, Missing Salmon Alliance Salmon Ecosystem Data Hub) and will centralise data from the DCF and the WFD, spread between the different Member States and working groups. 
Subtasks
1. Identify the needs of different working groups.
2. Discuss interoperability and storage with ICES and GFCM.
3. Propose a template suitable for different species.
4. Validate the structure by testing the integration of data provided by the project partners.
